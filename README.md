This is the Labchain Open Sourced version. 

Labchain offers a way to securely exchange health records (but other kinds of transactions  are perfectly possible too)

It runs on any ethereum-compatible network.

It sends transactions with IPFS hashes using web3js from node to node. 


We provided a nice UI with dropzone.js to drop files and make it for the end user very easy to use.

Installation instructions:

Runs on any php enabled (linux) web server. Just drop the files in the /var/www/ directory
For secure exchange of files ipfs is needed. Install via ipfs.io

Web3js is provided, as well as Trezor login (not finalized yet).
