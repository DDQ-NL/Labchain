This is the Labchain Open Sourced version. 

Labchain offers a way to securely exchange health records (but other kinds of transactions  are perfectly possible too)

It runs on any ethereum-compatible network.

It sends transactions with IPFS hashes using web3js from node to node. 

We provide a nice UI with dropzone.js to drop files and make it for the end user very easy to use.


We also have a certified pro version: using a privacy blockchain and solidity contracts. Just drop us an email if you are interested (web@ddq.nl)
